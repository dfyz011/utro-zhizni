# ocean of childhood

It was early morning, the rain was filling the recesses of the ocean's bare gums. It was intensifying, by now my friends had taken shelter from the rain, and I, slipping my already soaked shirt over my head, continued to observe what was happening around me. I was amazed at the beauty and vibrancy of the pools that appeared at dawn. I was fortunate enough to watch an entire sea country wake up, nestled close to the beach, in an acid green forest of fabulous, tangled algae and coral.

From afar I noticed a man walking in my direction, I couldn't make it out at first, but as he got closer I saw a fishing rod in his hands. I was so interested in everything that I followed him. I made my way along the already raging ocean, along the morning reef, skirting rocks, jumping over holes, stopping only to pick up another fossilized shell along the way. He stood by a huge boulder, pulled out his pre-prepared tackle, and with a broad sweep of his arm launched the antenna with the treat into the underwater realm. I could not tear my eyes away: the rock behind which he was sheltering from the waves was receiving the strong embrace of the water on all sides, so that I could imagine how great was the love of the elements.For a moment I could not keep my feet from the impending force, which naturally swept me off my feet, plunging me headfirst into the water on the one hand, and on the other into his distant but very tangible childhood, which I was able to touch with all the senses of my human being.

He remembered his sister, with whom he had walked in the same place, at the same time, but in the far, far past. The water was noisier, more visible in its manifestations, but still the same, after a vast number of years and stories, he could watch life flow.

I love catching moments of the vast, ocean-cleared eucalyptus reefs. Appreciating each story along with those who give them to me, showing and exposing them like a fully life-filled ocean this morning.

It is with great love that I thank Denis Mironov for this music. You sound from the very depths of your heart and I hear the ocean through these melodies, dear friend.
