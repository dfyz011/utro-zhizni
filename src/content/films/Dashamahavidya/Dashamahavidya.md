# Dashamahavidya

Sometimes everything that was done before doesn't fit anymore, and in order to start a new story, you have to get rid of that baggage. Burning the old, gradually adding to the ashes of the fire every detail that was so important before. It's all very valuable too, but in order to meet the new, you'll have to say goodbye to what came before. Transformation.

A change of outlook, a change of attitude towards yourself and others. It's scary and delightful at the same time. It's the end and the beginning at the same time.

Preserve and increase your renewal.
And then the power that guides will lead to the right path. Transformation.
