# moon and sun

Moon and Sun. Part 1.

I spent the last five days before my trip to Nepal with new and old friends. Each day I recorded an observation video of men and women in love with each other. I watched how they relate to the world, looking together or apart, how their invisible partners and themselves interact, how they socialize, love, live.

There is an inner man in every woman, just as there is an inner woman in every man. And I am very interested in the topic of masculinity and femininity, I wonder what it is and how it manifests in me and others.

In this part of the movie, Egor and Cami talk about how they feel about this topic.
